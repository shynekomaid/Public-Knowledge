### Convenient Gitmoji Commits

When you commit changes to your Git repository, it's important to use clear and descriptive commit messages. Avoid using generic messages like `123` or `fix` and instead **focus on describing what changed and why.**

One way to create more descriptive commit messages is to use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/). **Gitmoji** is a set of emojis that you can use in your commit messages to indicate the type of change you made. Here are some examples of **Gitmoji** you can use:

- 🐛 for fixes
- 🎨 for changes to the design or layout
- 📝 for changes to documentation
- 🔥 for removing code or files

To use **Gitmoji** in your commit messages, simply add the appropriate emoji at the beginning of your message. For example, if you fixed a bug, your commit message might look like this:

```Commit message
🐛 Fix issue with login form
```

> By using **Gitmoji** in your commit messages, you can make your commits more descriptive and easier to understand for yourself and others working on the project.
>
> **Notice:** copy emoji as character, use `✨` instead of `:sparkles:`, or use [Gitmoji VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode).
